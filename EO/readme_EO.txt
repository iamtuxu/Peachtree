Here is the readme file for the event-oriented simulation part. 

Please use mainSim.py to launch the simulation.

Arc.py: the class for the lanes, and corresponding functions for calculating the travel time
basicFunction.py: the basic functions including maximum function and random number generation
Event.py: the definations of the events, including a parent event class and all chidren classes
mainSim.py: the main function locates here
Node.py: the node class and corresponding functions
VehicleDiscreteFlow.py: the vehicle class and all the parameters.
